    This function performs runs series of scripts that performs the following steps:
    1. Simulate gene expression data, ignorning the sample-experiment relationship
    2. Add varying numbers of technical variation
    3. Compare the similarity of the gene expression structure between the simulated data
        vs simulated data + technical variation.  

    Arguments
    ----------
    run: int

        Number of top PCs to use to represent expression data

    file_prefix: str
